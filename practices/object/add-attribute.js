  Instructions: Implement a function named "addAttribute" that takes three arguments: "obj" (an existing object), 
  "key" (the name of the attribute), and "value" (the value of the key's property). Your task is to add a new attribute to the existing object.

  Note: The "obj", "key", and "value" parameters will never be undefined or null.
