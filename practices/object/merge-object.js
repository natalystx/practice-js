/*
  Instructions:
  Implement a function named "mergeObject" that takes two arguments, "obj1" and "obj2", which are objects.
  Your task is to merge the two objects together into a single object.

  If there are attributes with the same name in both obj1 and obj2,
  the attribute from obj2 should replace the existing attribute in obj1.

  Note: The obj, key, and value will never be undefined or null.

export function mergeObject(obj1, obj2) {
  // write your code here
