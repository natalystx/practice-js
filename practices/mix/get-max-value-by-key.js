        Instruction: implement a function named "getMaxValueByKey" the function will takes a array of product's object.
        Here is the shape of product's object
        {
            id: 1,
           name: "coke",
           weight: 100,
           price: 100.2
           amount: 2
        }
        Your task is get a specific item that has max value by given key

        then return them in project's object

        PS: data and key will never be undefined or null 
        data never be an empty array also
        if object's attribute doesn't contain key return null instead
