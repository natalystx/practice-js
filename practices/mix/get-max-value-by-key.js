/*
  Instruction: Implement a function named "getMaxValueByKey" that takes an array of product objects.
  Each product object has the following shape:
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "coke",
    weight: 100,
    price: 100.2,
    amount: 2
  }
  Your task is to find the product with the maximum value for a given key.

  Return the product object with the maximum value for the given key.
  If the key is not found in any of the product objects, return null.

  Note: The "data" parameter will never be undefined or null, and the "data" array will never be empty.

export function getMaxValueByKey(data, key) {
  // write your code here
}
