/*
  Instructions: Implement a function named "sortById" that takes an array of user objects as input.
  Each user object has the following shape:
  {
    id: 1,
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 18,
    gender: "male",
    dob: "1999-10-14",
    active: 0
  }
  Your task is to sort the array by user's id in ascending order and return the sorted array of user objects.

  Note: The input array will never be undefined or null.

export function sortById(users) {
  // write your code here
}
