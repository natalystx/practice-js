/*
  Instructions: Implement a function named "getActiveUser" that takes an array of user objects as input.
  Each user object has the following shape:
  {
    id: 1,
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 18,
    gender: "male",
    dob: "1999-10-14",
    active: 0
  }
  Your task is to create a new array of user objects that only contains active users.

  Return the new array of user objects as the output.

  Note: The input array will never be undefined or null.

export function getActiveUser(users) {
  // write your code here
}
