  Instructions: Implement a function named "mergeArray" that takes two arrays, "arr1" and "arr2", as input. 
  Your task is to merge the two arrays into a single array and return it. 
  The resulting array should contain only unique elements.

  Note: "arr1" and "arr2" will never be undefined or null, but they may be empty arrays.
